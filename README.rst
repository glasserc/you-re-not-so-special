You're Not So Special
=====================

A simple extension to disable links from opening in new tabs on
selected websites.

You're Not So Special is released under the MPL, version 2.0.

Rationale
=========

Links in tweets open in new tabs. Frequently I'll follow a link in a
tweet, read it, close it, and then forget that I've already read
it. Later, I'll see that I have tweet open that links to some article,
and I'll click on it to discover that it's an article I've already
seen. To avoid this, I've gotten in the habit of closing tweets as
soon as I click any links in them. But then I'll forget what the
context for an article or why I read it in the first place. If only
there were a "back" button that could take me back to the thing that
linked!

Some sites just seem to think that they can decide what to do when I
click a link. That's stupid. If I want a link to open in a new tab,
I'll hold Control when I click it. Maybe this behavior is supposed to
drive "engagement" or SEO, or maybe those websites think they are
"special" and that I won't want to leave. Sorry, Twitter, but *You're
Not So Special*.

Note that there *are* some legitimate uses of target="_blank" to open
in new tabs or windows. Some websites have "help" that pops up in a
new window. That's fine and I don't want to interfere with that. This
extension represents an attempt to fix the problem surgically.

TODO
====

- Use a smarter selector
- Apply to links from tweets on all pages rather than just twitter.com?
